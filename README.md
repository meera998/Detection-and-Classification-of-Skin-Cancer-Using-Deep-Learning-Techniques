# Detection-and-Classification-of-Skin-Cancer-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

Skin cancer is the most common disease in the US (United States). Health care providers and patients alike are tasked with identifying suspicious complexion lesions to diagnose skin cancers in an early stage and treat them in a short time. Recently, many innovative skin cancer detection technologies and techniques have been developed to increase diagnostic accuracy for skin cancers. This research paper presents a comprehensive study of using three popular deep learning models DenseNet121, ResNet18, and AlexNet to classify 25,331 labeled images in the ISIC-2019 dataset. The objective is to evaluate the performance and accuracy of each model and compare the results obtained in categorizing two classes which are Benign and Malignant. This study also highlights the key differences between the metrics of each model. The research found that all models achieved good accuracy in the prediction results. However, DenseNet121 demonstrated better performance in classifying the targets.

I.	INTRODUCTION 
Skin cancer represent a major health problem and it is one of the most dangerous and active types of cancers [1]. Early diagnosis is dependent on patient attention and accurate assessment by a medical practitioner. Therefore, if it is detected at early stages, it is more likely to be cured. Generally, skin cancer is categorized into two classes: melanoma and non-melanoma. Although melanoma is rare, it is the most hazardous type of skin cancer, and it has the highest rate of death globally. To beat this problem and improve the reliability of the diagnosis process, it is very important to develop computational tools and system for automated diagnosis that operate on quantitative measures. In this paper the performance of three types of deep convolutional neural network architecture namely ResNet18, DenseNet121, and AlexNet will be compared and discussed. Regarding the dataset, ISIC-2019, which is composed of 25,331 dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions, have been utilized to train all the models and predict the type of skin lesions. Furthermore, F-1, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy is also used to evaluate the performance of the models and compare them to explore which of them perform better. 
The motivation behind this research is to develop a prototype capable of extracting features and classifying skin cancer types from ISIC dataset. Additionally, ISIC is imbalanced which can impact the performance of the models and make them biased. This issue will be also addressed in this paper through applying some techniques along with striving to improve the accuracy of the models by experimenting different hyperparameter optimization, data augmentation etc.
