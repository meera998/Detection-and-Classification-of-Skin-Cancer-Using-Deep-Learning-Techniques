# Detection-and-Classification-of-Skin-Cancer-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

Skin cancer is the most common disease in the US (United States). Health care providers and patients alike are tasked with identifying suspicious complexion lesions to diagnose skin cancers in an early stage and treat them in a short time. Recently, many innovative skin cancer detection technologies and techniques have been developed to increase diagnostic accuracy for skin cancers. This research paper presents a comprehensive study of using three popular deep learning models DenseNet121, ResNet18, and AlexNet to classify 25,331 labeled images in the ISIC-2019 dataset. The objective is to evaluate the performance and accuracy of each model and compare the results obtained in categorizing two classes which are Benign and Malignant. This study also highlights the key differences between the metrics of each model. The research found that all models achieved good accuracy in the prediction results. However, DenseNet121 demonstrated better performance in classifying the targets.
